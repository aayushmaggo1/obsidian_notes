**Definition**

System thinking is a way to understand problems by focusing on relationships, feedback loops, and patterns - seeing the whole rather than isolated parts

- **Boundaries:** Define whatâ€™s inside and outside the system.
    
- **Elements & Relationships:** Identify the parts and how they interact.
    
- **Feedback Loops:** Look for reinforcing or balancing cycles.
    
- **Delays:** Notice where cause and effect are separated by time.
    
- **Leverage Points:** Small changes that ripple through the system.
    
- **Unintended Consequences:** Watch for downstream effects.
