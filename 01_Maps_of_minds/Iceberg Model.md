**What it is:**  

The iceberg model is a visual metaphor used in [[Systems thinking]] to explain how events (the visible “tip of the iceberg”) are only the surface of deeper, hidden layers that shape behavior. Roughly 90% of an iceberg sits below the waterline, and likewise, most of the forces driving events are not immediately visible.

**Layers of the Iceberg:**

1. **Events (Tip of the Iceberg)**
    
    - What’s happening right now? The obvious, visible incident.
        
    - Example: A city experiences a sudden traffic jam.
        
2. **[[Patterns]] / [[Trends]] (Just below the surface)**
    
    - What has been happening over time? Repeated behaviors or recurring issues.
        
    - Example: Traffic jams always spike during rush hour, especially on Mondays.
        
3. **[[Systemic Structures]] (Deeper currents)**
    
    - What underlying rules, relationships, or infrastructures are shaping the patterns?
        
    - Example: City planning prioritizes cars over public transit, leading to congestion.
        
4. **[[Mental Models]] (The deepest layer, the bedrock)**
    
    - What beliefs, values, and assumptions are driving those structures?
        
    - Example: The cultural belief that owning and driving a car = independence and success.

**Where it comes in systems thinking:**

- It helps shift attention away from “fixing the event” (a surface symptom) toward addressing deeper structures and mental models (root causes).
    
- It’s a diagnostic and sense-making tool: whenever you see a recurring problem, the iceberg model reminds you to ask, _what’s below the surface?_
    
- In systems thinking practice, it often comes into play at the stage of problem framing and root cause analysis.

**Everyday Examples:**

- **Health**
    
    - Event: A person catches the flu.
        
    - Pattern: They get sick every winter.
        
    - Structure: Lack of consistent sleep, poor diet, no preventive healthcare.
        
    - Mental Model: “I don’t have time to rest, productivity is more important than health.”
        
- **Workplace Burnout**
    
    - Event: An employee quits suddenly.
        
    - Pattern: High turnover every 6 months.
        
    - Structure: Workload and incentive structures push employees too hard.
        
    - Mental Model: Leadership believes “long hours equal dedication.”
        
- **Climate Change**
    
    - Event: A record-breaking heatwave.
        
    - Pattern: Heatwaves are increasing in frequency.
        
    - Structure: Reliance on fossil fuels, industrial practices.
        
    - Mental Model: Growth at all costs; humans separate from nature.

**Quick way to apply it yourself:**  
Whenever you notice a problem, pause and climb down the iceberg by asking:

- What just happened?
    
- Have I seen this before?
    
- What system might be encouraging this?
    
- What assumptions or worldviews sustain that system?
