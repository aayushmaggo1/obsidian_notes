**What is Flask?**  

Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python. It helps you turn Python functions into web endpoints (URLs → functions → responses). Flask gives you the essentials (routing, request/response handling, template rendering) without forcing a heavy structure.

**Why use Flask?**
- Minimal and flexible — start tiny, grow as needed.
- Great for prototypes, APIs, and learning how web stuff works.
- Large ecosystem of extensions when you need more features.

## Quick start
1. Install:

   ```bash
   pip install 
   bash```
